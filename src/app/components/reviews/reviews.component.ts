  // Hey Cole,

  // I wanted to touch base as soon as I got the feedback from our teams. 
  // First, thanks for taking time to meet with some of them this week and for completing the code challenge. 
  // However, please know this was not an easy decision, but we ended up moving forward with another candidate.

  // Some concerns were around your technical interview. 
  // One thing the team was hoping to see was stronger experience in Angular as a whole. 
  // The team mentioned that it took a bit longer to refactor than expected for a sr. level candidate 
  // and that it took equally as long to get the component state and handlers hooked up. 
  // Thanks again for talking to our team and giving us the opportunity to learn about your skills and accomplishments Cole. 
  // We'll be posting more positions in the coming months and hope youâ€™ll keep us in mind then, we encourage you to apply again. 
  // All the best to you and happy holidays.
