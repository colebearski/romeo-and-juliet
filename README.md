# Top Secret - Shakespeare Reviews

## Project Summary

Shakespeare has been getting a lot of reviews recently about his plays. So far he has managed to build a backend API to serve them, but he doesn’t have the chops to finish out the UI. That’s where you come in, your task is to build a client side app for Shakespeare’s API.

This application was created using `Angular`.

We served Mr. Shakespeare with the following UI goodies:
- An aggregate rating
- Functionality to filter ratings
- Star icons relevant to their score
- Neat cards for each record
- Pagination
## Setup

1. `fork` and `clone` this repository.
2. `cd` into the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install current dependencies.
4. Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4201/`
## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
